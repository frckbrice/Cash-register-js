# Cash-register-js
the cash register return the user's change with as few notes from our cash register as possible.

CASH REGISTER is an app that help user on how to back change to the user with as few notes as possible.

HOW IT WORKS?

The UI show a table with currencies value at zero (00.00) after the page load. The user is the one to add the notes in his possession to the cash-in-draw.
After that, he can now add the cash (the note collected from customer) and the price (the bill to be paid by customer).Next, that he(user)
click to result button to see what to return as notes and coins to the customer.

The app also has a currency converter feature that help user to convert some currencies like USD, EUR, CNY, JPY, CAD currencies amongs themselves. 
Note: I chose this number of currencies for the sake of demo. But it is possible add others. i used an API converter for that.
